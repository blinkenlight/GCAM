v.2020-05-13:

New features:
  - Increased window and left panel sizes to also accommodate larger fonts
  - Added new action 'Mirror' under the 'Edit' menu
  - Changed default units for new projects to 'metric' and default pocketing
    strategy to 'serpentine'
  - Added a new isometric view preset and hotkeys to the 'View' menu
  - The Gerber file import dialog now pre-selects the smallest tool
  - Added limited support for 'rounded rectangle' pads to Gerber file import -
    only vertical/horizontal pads are supported currently, rotated ones are not
  - Added ability to control the number of linear segments used to approximate
    arbitrary curves on SVG file import via a new setting in 'settings.xml'
  - Added extra processing to contour offsetting that attempts to fix some of
    the simpler issues caused by the known limits of GCAM's contour offsetting
    algorithm when short segments and large tools are involved
  - Added ability to control the raster overlap and contour padding used during
    pocketing via a new setting in 'settings.xml'

Bug fixes:
  - Fixed locale settings causing g-code export to use the incorrect decimal
    separator symbol
  - Fixed long file names causing comment fields to overflow on file import
  - Fixed a drill file import incompatibility caused by recent changes in the
    file format related to decimal point handling
  - Fixed imperial/metric unit switching in 'New Project' and 'Project Settings'
  - Fixed inability to handle a lack of G54 statements on Gerber file import
  - Fixed a bug in Gerber file handling that could cause a crash
  - Fixed potentially incorrect plunging speed in 'Bolt Holes' blocks
  - Fixed a bug in contour offsetting that caused arcs milled with equal-radius
    tools and arcs spanning exactly 180 degrees to be skipped completely
  - Fixed some of the raster lines occasionally missing during pocketing
  - Fixed proposed values for rotation and mirroring not resulting in in-place
    transformations as they should if accepted

v.2015-05-13:

New features:
  - Added an option to use a slightly different pocketing strategy (that avoids
    z-axis moves if possible) to the g-code export dialog

Bug fixes:
  - Fixed a UI 'left panel' failure to update when a new object is inserted
  - Fixed missing Q word for G83 when peck depth is zero
  - Fixed main menu failing to become appropriately disabled under Unity

v.2015-04-13 (First GCAM Special Edition release)

New features:
  - Added a new XML-based file format for saving/loading GCAM projects (.gcamx)
  - Added ability to specify a file to load as a command line parameter
  - Added new actions 'Translate' and 'Rotate' under the 'Edit' menu
  - Added 'red square' discontinuity point markers for non-closed sketches
  - Added ability to handle a contiguous sketch as closed even if its elements
    are not listed in sequence of continuity in the block list
  - Added new action 'Optimize Order' under the 'Edit' menu, to sort (and flip)
    elements of a sketch into the actual order they are connected to each other
  - Added an option to use an equivalent sequence of basic motions instead of
    G8x "canned cycle" g-codes for drilling to the g-code export dialog
  - Added support for 'obround' (oval) pads to Gerber file import
  - Added a pass that reduces multiple smaller elements to fewer larger ones if
    possible during Gerber file import
  - Added original icon set for actions not covered by Gnome standard icons

Bug fixes:
  - Too many to list individually but they include various computation bugs
  typically involving arcs, block list drag-and-drop bugs, pocketing/extrusion
  bugs, removing originally disabled (and not implemented) STL file import from
  the 'File' menu, fixing originally non-functional perspective view rendering,
  fixing originally non-functional SVG file import (paths only, no transforms)
  and fixing Gerber file import
  - Many parts of the code have also seen substantial structural changes not
  strictly tied to a specific bug
