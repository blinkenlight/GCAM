/**
 * Return -1 if the "inside" of the closed curve 'start_block' -> 'end_block' is
 * to the right of the curve, or +1 if the "inside" of the curve is to the left;
 * Intuitively, that is the same thing as saying the the curve is mostly bending
 * in the trigonometric negative direction ("to the right") if the result is -1
 * or in the trigonometric positive direction ("to the left") if +1 results;
 * It is assumed the chain of blocks starting with 'start_block' and ending with
 * 'end_block' is a contiguous closed contour that does not intersect itself. As
 * following such a curve would result in sweeping EXACTLY positive or negative
 * 360 degrees, adding up direction changes from block to block including angles
 * sweeped by arcs, then simply comparing to zero should yield the answer.
